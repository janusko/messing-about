* Your challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it lookign as close to the design as possible.
* This project is a collaborations between us, Scrimba, and Kevin Powell. If you'd like to see how Kevin would tackle this project, you can follow along on Scrimba's free course.
* If you're working through it yourself, please use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
* If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local data.json file from for the different page data. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.
* Your users should be able to:
* * View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
  * View the optiomal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
  * See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
* Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
